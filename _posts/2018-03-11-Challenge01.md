The Key Solution to this challenge is `Get-Content -wait` or `Get-Content -wait -tail` (for PSv3.0 onwards). This is actually Unix command `tail -F ` equivalent solution in powershell.

```powershell
#A Test case : Creating a runtime log for testing
1..100 | ForEach-Object {
  Write-Output "Mr. $_" | Out-File -FilePath $env:TEMP\test.log -Append | Set-Content  
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 1    
}
```

Now try executing the command on a seperate powershell session  
`Get-Content $env:TEMP\test.log -wait`  
Here you can see the content of log file being shown in your powershell session

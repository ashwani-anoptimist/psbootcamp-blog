title: How to read runtime data of a text file (log) when it is being written?

The Key Solution to this challenge is `Get-Content -wait` or `Get-Content -wait -tail` (for PSv3.0 onwards)

```powershell
#A Test case : Creating a runtime log for testing
Get-Content "c:\temp\test.log"-wait
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
```
